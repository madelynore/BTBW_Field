Dataset Abstract

	Diazo copy of Hubbard Brook Watershed Map generated stereophoto- grammetrically
                based on May, 1956 aerial photography. Shows New Hampshire state plane coordinate
                system reference points which were projected into UTM Zone 19 and used as reference
                tics. The roads and trails locations were manually digitized. In 2014, roads data layer was updated to
                reflect road locations as indicated in lidar data. Data distributed as shapefile in 
                Coordinate system EPSG:26919 - NAD83 / UTM zone 19N.
